But ICL has made up to the headlines when it signed players like Brian Lara (West Indies), Stephen Fleming (New Zealand) and Dinesh Mongia (India). Many other mainstream cricket players are on line to join. Some reject such kind of league formation outsite ICC's authorization and some hails the League saying that it will surely help in reducing ICC's monopoly in International Cricket.<br /><br />The most interesting factor is that ICL is starting its campaign from Twenty20 cricket. Co-incidentally ICC's Twenty20 World Cup is on in Safari Nation - South Africa. One thing is evident the popularity of cricket is on high. You won't be finding so many formats (3 different formats as: Test Cricket, One Day Cricket, Twenty20 Cricket) in any other game apart from cricket.<br /><br />ICC's sponsorship crisis always hurts players' individual sponsors as sponsoring companies always target such big tournaments for brand awareness. I don't know how ICL is perceiving this issue. But it is almost clear that ICL is going to give lucrative amounts to its member players. This has been a matter of concern for ICC as most of the ICC registered players are joining ICL. This would be the perfect topic for t currently.<br /><br />I would love to receive your comments and replies on this topic.<div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj"></div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">I'm not sure whether the Indian Cricket League can be called "saviour" of the players or not. It is simply another commercial enterprise - like Packer's World Series, but with an Indian twist to it, that is, jealousy will eventually get the most of it. Jealousy from those cricketers who have not been invited or jealousy from those who aren't sharing piece of the pie.<br /><br />This is not to say that it won't succeed because if you throw enough money and market it properly, anything will work in this world these days. Cricket is a sure money earner in India.<br /><br />LDK</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj"></div><div class="o_post_auth">CricMan</div><div class="o_post_text"><blockquote><div>I'm not sure whether the Indian Cricket League can be called "saviour" of the players or not.

Money is there because viewers are there. Otherwise no cricket would have been possible without players. Another fact is clear the existing official cricket boards' monopoly ruling has really scrambled the game. We can take the example of Ajit Agarkar's selection in the Indian National Cricket squad. Don't you think this as a part of cricket politics. Despite continuous bad performance, he has been selected. Rather I would say this has occured due to Dilip Vengsarkar and his allies (including BCCI President Sarad Power). Had there been Dalmia, He would not have been selected in the squad. I'm not a supporter of Dalmia rather I would say, whatever you do you must support the good player but in exchange of good players. There are thousands of excellent players who has been waiting for a single call. They must be called in exchange of these cricket garbages. What is come back, I think Agarkar might hav e forgotten. I would advise him to join ICL. Because he is playing for money not for India.</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">too much</div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">I think this twenty20 craze is becoming a joke.<br /><br />Lets take an example. India will have TWO leagues now, that's a LOT of twenty20 for one nation to digest, even if that nation happens to be a billion cricket mad nation. What will the rest of the world do? Will they keep sending their worn out horses to graze in the Indian twenty20 pastures??<br /><br />I love the entertainment value and glamour of twenty20 and also 'cause it is a nice time out from heavy tests and ODIs.<br /><br />But..... I think both the Indian Premier League and the Indian Cricket League will cancel each other out. There will be just too much of it. Infact i wouldnt be surprised if they both merge into one after everyone realizes what overkill it can become.</div></div>					<span class="crickety">www.crickety.com</span>
