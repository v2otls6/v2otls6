"<br />Hey Crickman, timed out means a batsman can be declared out if he fails to come to the crease in 5 mins. After a batsman is out, if the next batsman takes more then 5 mins to come to the crease and the fielding team appeals, he can be declared out.<br />Till date no one has been Timed Out in cricket<br />Reply by<b></b>[Member] Posts: 6 Location: Delhi<br />Mon Mar 19, 2007 11:09 am | 174<br /><i></i><br />Hey Tamanna,<br />U sure abt no one being given Timed Out in cricket???<br />Why do i hve this nasty feeling that Inzi was out sometime ago like this!!!!<br />Reply by<b></b>[Member] Posts: 15 Location: India<br />Tue Mar 20, 2007 12:49 pm | 183<br /><i></i><br />Yeah...Inzi is really lazy...but somehow he managed to stay out of this list.....and now there is no chance of his making to that list.....Inzi had called it a day....<br />Reply by<b></b>[Member] Posts: 15 Location: India<br />Mon Mar 26, 2007 10:50 am | 200<br /><i></i><br />Now Inzi will never be Timed Out.....<br />Reply by<b></b>[Member] Posts: 1<br />Fri May 11, 2007 5:36 pm | 256<br /><i></i><br />Sourav Ganguly is the only cricketer to have won four successive Man of the Match awards in One-day Internationals.<br />The first Test match began on 15 March 1877 and had a timeless format with four balls per over. It ended on 19 March 1877 with Australia winning by 45 runs.<br />The first Twenty20 international was between Australia and New Zealand in 2005.<br />The Test match between England and South Africa at Durban in 1939 was finally abandoned as a draw on the tenth day because England players had to catch their ship home.<br />The First Test between Young Sri Lanka and Young England at Columbo in 1987 was held up when a large iguana crept across the wicket.<br />Pakistan Railways beat Dera Ismail Khan by an innings and 851 runs in 1964. In reply to the railwaymen’s 910 for 6 declared, Dera Ismail Khan were bowled out 32 and 27.<br />Sussex batsman H.J. Heygate was given out in a match with Somerset in 1919 because he didn’t reach the crease within two minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. Poor Heygate was crippled with rheumatism.<br />Reply by<b>curdie</b>[Guest]<br />Sat Mar 08, 2008 7:14 am | 383<br /><i>Jones</i><br />Great Job done.
