					<p class="Message">Choosing an all time West Indies Team from different era is challenging, but stimulating. Each Team should consist of one of the following;<br /><br />2 opening batsman 3 middle order batsman, 1 wicketkeeper/wicketkeeper batsman, 2 pace/fast bowler, 1 spin bowler and<b>the last two spots can be any postion</b>or<br /><br />2 opening batsman, 3 middle order batsman, 1 wicketkeeper/wicketkeeper batsman, 1 allrounder, 2 pace/fast bowler, 1 spin bowler<b>and the last spot can be any position.</b><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Lets look at our openers:</b></span>Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Roy Fredericks, Sir Conrad Hunte, Chris Gayle, Allan Rae, Jeffrey Stolleymeyer, Wavell Hinds (can open or bat middleorder) and Clifford Roach.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Middle order batsman:</b></span>Sir Vivian Richards, Ritchie Richardson, Lawrence Rowe, Jimmy Adams, George Headley, Seymour Nurse, Sir Everton Weeks, Sir Frank Worrell, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Alvin Kallicharran, Rohan Kanhai, Clive Lloyd, Shivnarine Chanderpaul-(open in ODI), Hilary Gomez, Charlie Davis and Brian Lara.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>wicketkeeper/wicketkeeper batsman</b></span>: Sir Clyde Walcott, Jeffrey Dujon, Deryck Murray and Jackie Hendericks<br /><br />Allrounders: Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Leary Constantine, Dwayne Bravo and Carl Hooper.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pace/Fast Bowler:</b></span>Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding, Anderson Roberts, Joel Garner, Colin Croft, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Ian Bishop, Patrick Patterson, Roy Gilchrist, Wesley Hall, and Charlie Davis.<br /><br />Based on the aformentioned cricketers, I will now choose my 'All time 1st team in chronological order;<br /><br />Gordon Greenidge: Arguably West Indies greatest opening batsman<br />Desmond Haynes: West Indies most sucessful opening batsman alongside Greenidge.<br />George Headley: The greatest West Indies batsman of his era<br />Sir Vivian Richards: Indubitably The most destructive batsman ever<br />'Prince' Brian Lara: Considered one of the greatest batsman of all time, can be aggressive, and also be reliable-400 &amp; 501 not out.<br />Sir Garfield Sobers-Undeniably the greatest allrounder<br />Sir Clyde Walcott-One of the famous 'W's (Sir Everton Weeks, and Sir Frank Worrell-the other two)<br />Malcolm Marshall-West Indian greatest fast/pace bowler<br />Michael Holding 'Whispering Death' The quickest of 'em all '<br />Curtly Ambrose One of the most economical bowler<br />Lance Gibbs-West Indies greatest off spinner<br /><br /><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Team</span></b><br /><br />Sir Conrad Hunte-The greatest West Indies opening batsman of his time.<br />Roy Fredericks-a great hook shot<br />Rohan Kanhai-The most creative batsman<br />Sir Everton Weeks-One of the famous 'W's<br />Sir Frank Worrell-Same as above<br />Clive Lloyd-West Indies greatest &amp; most sucessful captain, whom save West Indies from defeat several times<br />Jeffrey Dujon-a strokeplayer, an elegant batsman a wicketkeeper batsman<br />Anderson Roberts-The premier of West Indies four pronged pace attack created in the 70's by captain Clive Lloyd<br />Joel'Big Bird Garner-Same as Curtly Ambrose-very economical bowler.<br />Alf Valentine-Great spinner<br />Courtney Walsh-West Indies most durable pace/fast bowler<br /><br /><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My final -third team</span></b><br /><br />Chris Gayle- One of the best ODI (One day player<br />Alf Valentine-Unfotunately no place for Jeff Stolleymeyer as I can only choose two openers<br />Lawrence Rowe- One of the most graceful batsman-unfortunately eyesight diminished<br />Alvin Kallicharran-a diminutive batsman whom can stroke with the best<br />Seymour Nurse-underatted batsman<br />Shivnarine Chanderpaul-One of the most dependable batsman<br />Deryck Murray-can bat better than Jackie Hendericks<br />Wesley Hall-One of the pioneers of West Indies pace/fast bowler<br />Charlie Griffith-One of the deadliest yorker<br />Colin Croft- One of the geratest outswinger/inswinger pace/fast bowler<br />Sonny Ramadhin-Note can be chosen in second team its a flip coin between him and Valentine :<br /><br />Please note that players with immense talent whom did not live up to expectation were Carl Hooper-when on form, he can bat with the best<br />Ramnaresh Sarwan-still developing a talent waiting to happen. Augustine Logie- a diminutive batsman whom had array of strokes-too inconsistent. Unfortunately The great Sir Leary Constantine, Sorry!!<br />'<br />Note: Charlie Davis has a great average of over 50, but I rate him as a good batsman, not an elite batsman and Larry Gomes and Jimmy Adams- painstaking batsmen-but not an elite. Ritchie Richardson-great batsman, but he batted at the number 3 position, where the likes of the Master Blater ' Viv Richards, 'The Black Bradman' George Headley, Rohan Baboolall Kanhai, Sir Everton Weeks; and Lawrence Rowe batted. Ian Bishop was a great fast bowler, but West Indies had elite bowlers. Also Patrick Patterson and Roy Gilchrist can match Michael Holding with speed, but not accuracy and line and length and Jermaine Taylor is the upcoming fast/pace bowler whom has the potential to materialized to an elite player.<br /><br />Please share your opinions and/or comment and God bless you all.<div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Greatest Team</div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">In my view Conrad Hunte and Andy Roberts should have made he first 11.Conrad Hunte was a batsman in the Gordon Geenidge class wih immaculate technique.Andy Roberts was the most innovative fast bowler of all -the closest West Indian equivalent of Dennis Lillee.No West Indian fast bowler had a greater repertoire of deliveries and such control and variation of pace.I agree that Rohan Kanhai was the most creative but fell out out of lack of consistency.To me Haynes and Ambrose may make the 2nd 11.<br />By the way yesterday was Sir George Headley's 100th birthday.Had he played in the 1970's or in the modern ra he may have become the best West Indian batsman of all time o or atleast 2nd to Bradman.Imagine Bradman was called the White Headley.<br />Viv Richards was the most punishing batsman of all with Everton Weekes.No batsman could change the complexion of a game more than Sir Viv.Had Rohan Kanhai done justice to his natural talent he might well have been the best West Indian batsman of all.Overall perhaps Brian Lara is the best ever West Indian batsman considering the pressure he handled combined wih his phenomenal apetite for runs.</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Swannee</div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">Sir Everton Weekes should ne in the 1st eleven he averaged close to 60 and scored 5 consecutive test match hundreds. He was given out (run out) in the sixth innings when in the nineties but claims he was in by at least two yards</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Greatest ever West Indian XI</div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">1.

Sylvester Clarke - Extremely hostile fast bowler who was available in the wrong era. Too many bowlers already available<br /><br />2. Tony Gray - Trini fast bowler w. test bowling average of 17.13. Plagued by injuries that kept him out of tests but definitely one to keep in mind<br /><br />3. Jimmy Adams<br /><br />4. Leonard Baichan<br /><br />5. Franklyn Rose<br /><br />6.
