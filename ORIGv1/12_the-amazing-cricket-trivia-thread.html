I will add more later, thanks. <br />Reply by <b></b> [First-100 Member] Posts: 1 <br />Thu Dec 08, 2005 5:51 am | 19 <br /><i>one more</i><br />Just saw this in cricinfo: <br />Vikram Solanki is the first ever SuperSub player in ODIs.<br />Reply by <b></b> [Member] Posts: 2 <br />Fri Jul 28, 2006 9:46 pm | 61 <br /><i></i><br />i knew about that about martin crowes cousin.but i never knew about the 1st man to wear a helmet<br />Reply by <b></b> [Member] Posts: 7 <br />Sun Feb 18, 2007 4:10 pm | 136 <br /><i>more trivia</i><br />Hanif Mohammed (Pakistan) batted for 16 hours and 10 minutes - nearly 3 full days - against the West Indies, scoring 337*. <br />There are 10 ways a batsman can be declared "out" in cricket: <br />1. Caught <br />2. Bowled <br />3. Leg Before Wicket <br />4. Hit Wicket <br />5. Timed Out (wonder what is this?) <br />6. Handling the ball <br />7. Obstructing the field <br />8.

" <br />Hey Crickman, timed out means a batsman can be declared out if he fails to come to the crease in 5 mins. After a batsman is out, if the next batsman takes more then 5 mins to come to the crease and the fielding team appeals, he can be declared out. <br />Till date no one has been Timed Out in cricket <br />Reply by <b></b> [Member] Posts: 6 Location: Delhi <br />Mon Mar 19, 2007 11:09 am | 174 <br /><i></i><br />Hey Tamanna, <br />U sure abt no one being given Timed Out in cricket??? <br />Why do i hve this nasty feeling that Inzi was out sometime ago like this!!!! <br />Reply by <b></b> [Member] Posts: 15 Location: India <br />Tue Mar 20, 2007 12:49 pm | 183 <br /><i></i><br />Yeah...Inzi is really lazy...but somehow he managed to stay out of this list.....and now there is no chance of his making to that list.....Inzi had called it a day.... <br />Reply by <b></b> [Member] Posts: 15 Location: India <br />Mon Mar 26, 2007 10:50 am | 200 <br /><i></i><br />Now Inzi will never be Timed Out..... <br />Reply by <b></b> [Member] Posts: 1 <br />Fri May 11, 2007 5:36 pm | 256 <br /><i></i><br />Sourav Ganguly is the only cricketer to have won four successive Man of the Match awards in One-day Internationals. <br />The first Test match began on 15 March 1877 and had a timeless format with four balls per over. It ended on 19 March 1877 with Australia winning by 45 runs. <br />The first Twenty20 international was between Australia and New Zealand in 2005. <br />The Test match between England and South Africa at Durban in 1939 was finally abandoned as a draw on the tenth day because England players had to catch their ship home. <br />The First Test between Young Sri Lanka and Young England at Columbo in 1987 was held up when a large iguana crept across the wicket. <br />Pakistan Railways beat Dera Ismail Khan by an innings and 851 runs in 1964. In reply to the railwaymen’s 910 for 6 declared, Dera Ismail Khan were bowled out 32 and 27. <br />Sussex batsman H.J. Heygate was given out in a match with Somerset in 1919 because he didn’t reach the crease within two minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. Poor Heygate was crippled with rheumatism.<br />Reply by <b>curdie</b> [Guest] <br />Sat Mar 08, 2008 7:14 am | 383 <br /><i>Jones</i><br />Great Job done.

Turns out it was against England in 1952.
