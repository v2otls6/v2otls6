<p class="Message"> i bought a new bat for 50quid but its a bit heavy and quite big i was wondering weather to buy a new bat for 30quid of this site <a class="postlink" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cricketdirect.com/acatalog/_Hunts_County_Junior.html">http://www.cricketdirect.com/acatalog/_ ... unior.html</a><br /><br />ryt at the bottom there are 2 bats i was wondering which one is better and which i should get <br /><br />also should i by i new cheap bat or go on ebay or buy an old bat thats really cheap?????????<div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj"> </div><div class="o_post_auth">UncleBob </div><div class="o_post_text">dont compromise on price. you batting is as good as the bat i would say go with the one you're most comfortable with </div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Best cricket bat </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text">It's true that you shouldn't compromise on the price, but you can also make the most of an inexpensive bat if you know what you're shopping for. There have been several theories regarding which cricket bat is the best. The trick is to find the right combination of weight and "pick up" of the bat. You should see if the weight of the bat is balanced or distributed along the willow. Many batsmen prefer bats that are heavier down below as it makes it easier to drive elegantly.<br /><br />You should also see whether a bat you buy has been knocked in properly or not. Some more expensive bats come pre-knocked and they are usually on the higher end of the pricing spectrum. Your bat should come with some instructions or a brochure that describes the condition of the bat and whether it has been knocked or not. If you choose a less expensive bat, you could use a special hammer tool or a mallet to knock the bat, oil and such. In any case, do not use your brand new bat to for match straight out of the store! Always get some knocking in done before going for your big bat debut, if the bat has not been knocked in. Check out <a class="postlink" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.owzat-cricket.co.uk/about_cricket_bats/about_cricket_bats.htm">http://www.owzat-cricket.co.uk/about_cr ... t_bats.htm</a> for some good tips.<br /><br />As far as the wood of the bat is concerned, traditional English willow is considered superior. The cricket bat willows are in several grades. Do some research on the various grades. Don't be confused with terms like Titanium or Carbon, though. These are not made of titanium but wood. However, newer and less expensive bats use the Kashmir willow just as much and are great for keeping a variety in your armoury. </div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">GRIZZLY - the new Newbery bat - looks awesome </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text">I got a GRIZZLY (pink) Newbery bat for Christmas and it looks and feels fantastic - just took it to winter nets and it certainly turned a few heads. <br /><br />I think you can only get it from PRO4SPORT (.co.uk), or from the Sussex cricket shop (the Sussex captain Chris "Grizzly" Adams will be using it next year apparently).<br /><br /><a class="postlink" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pro4sport.co.uk/cricket/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=841&amp;cat=The+Grizzly">http://www.pro4sport.co.uk/cricket/shop ... he+Grizzly</a><br /><br />The bat looks so cool I have emailed pro4sport to find out if there is going to be a Grizzly range.

My club has been signed up by Pro4Sport on their rebate scheme so my club earned £40 today as I bought pads and gloves too. Apparently we have £700 in our kitty so far in 2and a1/2 months.<br />The shop they have is awesome I could have stayed there all day, and they were very knowledgable and helpful I even got a cup of coffee.<br />They were telling me that they have signed up over 100 clubs so far and growing by the day I think this is an awesome initiative as most clubs find it hard to raise funds.<br />They are also doing our teamwear for 2008 which looks fantastic and they will even hold stock of our items so we don't have minimum order problems in the summer.<br /><br />Well done and thanks<br /><br />Lawrence </div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">What I have - What I've heard </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text">I ve got a Gray Nicolls Predator, and it has one of the sweetest middles, considering it's price.

It's not a big bat...more suited to guys who like to be "class acts" with nice cut shots,drives,pull shots and so on. Edges are about an inch in width to be more specific and the Viper also has GN's brilliant "scoop" technology where they're 4 grooves cut out in the back of the bat which help with balance &amp; give a very light pick up.
