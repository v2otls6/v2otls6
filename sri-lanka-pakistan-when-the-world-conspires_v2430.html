<p>"When you want something with all your heart, the whole world conspires to make it happen." - Paulo Coelho. &nbsp;That is literally the case with Pakistan cricket. The Cricket world has come together and decided to partially resume playing cricket in Pakistan. A squad of 14 players, representing seven cricketing nations is scheduled to play a 3-match T20 series starting from 12th September.</p><p>In 2009, the touring Sri Lankan team was attacked by terrorists. 6 Sri Lankan cricketers were non-fatally injured. 6 Pakistani police officers and 2 civilians were killed in the attack. </p><p>The entity that also suffered fatal wounds was Cricket in Pakistan. They got scrapped from hosting 2011 World Cup &amp; any other cricket ties. Apart from the solitary visit by Zimbabwe in 2015 &amp; PCL Final 2017, there was no international cricket in Pakistan. The crowd could only watch their heroes perform in 2-D, on their screens.  </p><p>In June this year, ICC got together and confirmed a three-match T20 series to be played in Pakistan. Andy Flower was tasked to assemble a squad that would represent goodwill of cricket world for Pakistan.</p><p>As the Du-Plessis led team lands on Pakistani soil, let us revisit similar times when the World united to play cricket.</p><p> Rest of the World XI against England, 1970-71</p><p>It was Politics that gave birth to the first World XI team. South Africa was about to tour England. However, they had an objection on England choosing a certain player - Basil D'Oliviera. The inclusion of a non-white player was not acceptable to South Africa. </p><p>England's righteous stand meant that the tour got canceled. That was the only assignment England had in all summer. So the authorities came up with a novel idea. Sir Garfield Sobers led a team filled with superstars to take against England </p><p>The team had Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards, Clive Lloyd, Lance Gibbs, Farokh Engineer and other such talented players. The England team fielded their best-  Ray Illingworth, Geoffrey Boycott, John Snow, Colin Cowdrey, Derek Underwood and other English legends.</p><p>Although ROW (Rest of world) ended up winning 4-1, the series was a close affair. Centuries from Sobers, Boycott, Pollock, D'Oliviera, Luckhurst &amp; Kanhai meant batting master class was on display. The crowd was treated to excellent bowling as well with John Snow, Peter Lever, Intikhab Alam &amp; Gary Sobers being in the fray.</p><p>The series was marred by few other events such as General elections and Commonwealth games running in parallel. But it was the start of seeing players of different nationalities coming together like a team of superheroes assembling. </p><p>Rest of the World cricket team in Australia in 1971–72</p><p>With South Africa out of the International cricket frame, Australia also faced a similar ordeal as that of England- a blank season. ROW now toured Australia to play their second series.</p><p>Few more legends such as Sunil Gavaskar, Bishan Bedi, Zaheer Abbas were thrown into the mix. It was quite a long tour. There were 5 tests and 3 ODIs against Australia. Apart from this, they also played 9 matches against various state teams.</p><p>ROW managed to win the Test series 2-1 while the ODI series was drawn 1-1 with one match abandoned. ROW won/drew tour games against State teams as well, only South Australia handed them a defeat.</p><p>Ian &amp; Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee were some of the Australians who dazzled the series with their performance against the World XI.</p><p>World Cricket Tsunami Appeal - 2004</p><p>In 2004, it was a natural disaster that caused the cricketing world to unite. Rising waves of Tsunami engulfed the island of Sri Lanka. To raise a relief fund, a match between Asia XI and World XI was played. </p><p>World XI led by Ricky Ponting contained five Aussies other than himself.  Three New Zealanders, three West Indians &amp; Darren Gough from England completed the squad. </p><p>Asia XI was comprised of six Indians, four Sri Lankans, two Pakistani players &amp; the sole Bangladeshi in Alok Kapali.</p><p>The team mix was quite interesting and promised to be a close affair. It, however, turned out to be a one-sided affair. Gayle-Gilchrist opened the innings for World XI. Ponting-Lara batted together at number 3 &amp; 4. It was an incredible sight!</p><p>Ricky Ponting soon completed his century and cut loose. Cairns-Vettori took the score to 344. Asia XI failed miserably in chasing the mammoth total. The top scorer was Rahul Dravid with 75 runs and team got all out for 232.</p><p>Matches between Africa XI &amp; Asia XI were also played later to help Tsunami relief funds.</p><p>ICC Super Series - 2005</p><p>This was probably the most professional effort to combine The World to take on the best team of the era - Australia. ICC’s other objective wanted to increase their global outreach &amp; achieve budget targets.</p><p>World XI was chosen by a panel of former players consisting Sunil Gavaskar, Aravinda De Silva, Clive Lloyd etc. The team consisted of the best players from major cricketing nations.</p><p>Players were chosen in equal proportions, with a maximum of 2 players from a country. The combination looked great and all set to beat the reigning champions at their home.</p><p>But the World XI was beaten black and blue. In all the 3 ODIs, they were defeated by huge margins. Gayle's half-century in 48 balls in the second ODI gave slight hope but even that match ended with a crushing defeat. </p><p>The Test was an even sorrier affair. Played at Sydney, Australia won the toss and chose to bat first. A century from Matthew Hayden and Gilchrist's 94 took the hosts to 345 at the end of 1st innings. Andrew Flintoff picked 4/94. </p><p>In the next three innings, no team could cross 200 runs. World XI was spun into the web by Australian spinners as Shane Warne &amp; Stuart MacGill ended up with 15 out of 20 wickets between themselves. </p><p>World XI lost the Test by 210 runs. Australia stomped them. The most prominent reason for such a poor outing was pointed to be the casual behaviour of the World XI team.</p><p>This was the last of such efforts. The previous attempts were not so memorable due to lack of intense contest and determination amongst players to out-perform each other.</p><p>As the World-XI now prepares to face Pakistan at their home, let's hope they give their best to beat Pakistan. On the other hand, the Pakistani team will be extremely eager to perform in front of their ardent fans.</p><p>Let's hope that only action we get to see is on the ground and not outside of it. Cricket in Pakistan shall add a new dimension to cricket and a new place for current players to prove their mettle. Let's hope for the best, and may the sport of Cricket win!</p><p>(@oam_16 on twitter)</p>					<span class="crickety">www.crickety.com</span>
