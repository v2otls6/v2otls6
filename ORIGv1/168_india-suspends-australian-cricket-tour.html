<p class="Message"> The Indian cricket board has suspended its tour of Australia pending the outcome of an appeal for suspended spinner Harbhajan Singh over alleged racist comments towards Andrew Symonds.<br /><br /><br />ARTICLE UPDATES: <a class="postlink" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23018108-5001021,00.html">http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/s ... 21,00.html</a><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Hint for India Cricket </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text">Hint: If one of the umpires is black, do not liken any opposing, black player to a monkey. </div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj"> </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text">some rules have to be incorporated by ICC to give the other teams a perfect clarification<br /> <br />(1) Ricky Ponting â€“ (THE TRULY GENUINE CRICKETER OF THE CRICKET ERA AND WHOSE INTEGRITY SHOULD NOT BE DOUBTED) should be considered as the FOURTH UMPIRE. As per the new rules, FOURTH UMPIRE decision is final and will over ride any decisions taken by any other umpires. ON-FIELD umpires can seek the assistance of RICKY PONTING even if he is not on the field. This rule is to be made, so that every team should understand the importance of the FOURTH UMPIRE.<br /> <br />(2) While AUSTRALIAN TEAM is bowling, If the ball flies anywhere close to the AUSTRALIAN FIELDER(WITHIN 5 metre distance), the batsman is to be considered OUT irrelevant of whether the catch was taken cleanly or grassed. Any decision for further clarification should be seeked from the FOURTH UMPIRE. This is made to ensure that the cricket is played with SPORTIVE SPIRIT by all the teams.<br /> <br />(3) While BATTING, AUSTRALIAN players will wait for the ON-FIELD UMPIRE decisions only (even if the catch goes to the FIFTH SLIP as the ball might not have touched the bat). Each AUSTRALIAN batsman has to be out FOUR TIMES (minimum) before he can return to the pavilion. In case of THE CRICKETER WITH INTEGRITY, this can be higher.<br /> <br />(4) UMPIRES should consider a huge bonus if an AUSTRALIAN player scores a century. Any wrong decisions can be ignored as they will be paid huge bonus and will receive the backing of the AUSTRALIAN team and board.<br /> <br />(5) All AUSTRALIAN players are eligible to keep commenting about all players on the field and the OPPONENT TEAM should never comment as they will be spoiling the spirit of the AUSTRALIAN team. Any comments made in any other language are to be considered as RACIALISM only.<br /> <br />(6) MATCH REFREE decisions will be taken purely on the AUSTRALIAN TEAM advices only. Player views from the other teams decisions will not be considered for hearing. MATCH REFREES are to be given huge bonus if this rule is implemented.<br /> <br />(7) NO VISITING TEAM should plan to win in AUSTRALIA. This is to ensure that the sportive spirit of CRICKET is maintained.<br /> <br />(8) THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE: If any bowler gets RICKY PONTING - â€œTHE UNDISPUTED CRICKETER WITH INTEGTIRY IN THE GAME OF CRICKETâ€? more than twice in a series, he will be banned for the REST OF THE SERIES. This is to ensure that the best batsman/Captain will be played to break records and create history in the game of CRICKET.<br /> <br />These rules will clarify better to the all the teams VISITING AUSTRALIA. </div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Expected </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text">Yup it was expected </div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Australians are the Americans of Cricket </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text"><img src="http&#58;//img177&#46;imageshack&#46;us/img177/917/44338788burning270am5&#46;jpg" alt="image" /><br /><br />This will get uglier in the days ahead. What the Australians don't realize, because of their hoity toity high-and-mighty remoteness to other cultures (or perhaps indifference) is that unlike them, a good part of cricket playing world has English as second language and any so called "slur" may not actually mean what it implies to a native speaker. This fact doesnt mean much to a person who only speaks and understands one language.<br /><br />BBC's reaction:<br /><br /><a class="postlink" rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7174122.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7174122.stm</a> </div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Flashpoints in cricket racism </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text">Racial flashpoints<br /><br />from The Guardian<br /><a class="postlink" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/australia/story/0,,2236890,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/australia/sto ... 90,00.html</a><br /><br />2007 <br />January South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs is banned for two Tests when a stump mic captures him saying to the crowd: "You fucking bunch of fucking animals, fucking go back to the zoo, fucking Pakistanis."<br /><br />October Australia's Andrew Symonds complains that Indian supporters made monkey noises towards him during a one-day international.<br /><br />2006<br />January The ICC appoints India's solicitor general, Goolam Vahanvati, to investigate racist abuse of South Africa and Sri Lanka players by Australian fans.<br /><br />August The former Australian batsman Dean Jones describes Hashim Amla, a South African batsman and devout Muslim, as "a terrorist" during what he thought was an advertising break while commentating on the South Africa v Pakistan series. Jones is immediately sacked by Ten Sports.<br /><br />September Australian umpire Darrell Hair is forced to deny he is a racist after accusing Pakistan of ball-tampering during the Oval Test against England. Pakistan refuse to take the field in protest and Hair rules that they have forfeited the Test - the first such verdict in Test history. The ICC anti-racism code is strengthened.<br /><br />2003<br />The Australian batsman Darren Lehmann becomes the first international cricketer to be banned for racial abuse for railing "black cunts" after a dismissal against Sri Lanka in Brisbane.<br /><br />1968<br />The England tour of South Africa is cancelled after the apartheid regime refuses to allow Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape coloured qualified for his adopted country, to play. The sporting boycott of South Africa begins.<br /><br />1953/54<br />During England's tour of the West Indies an unnamed player turns to an Indian diplomat during a dinner and asks: "Pass the salt, Gunga Din."<br />David Hopps </div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Australians are the Americans of Cricket? </div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous </div><div class="o_post_text">There's only one cricket nation dominating and perverting the course of international cricketing justice. The BCCI is the hegemony consistently abusing its power. India are the Americans of world cricket.<br />And don't insult our intelligence by saying "monkey" is a linguistic misunderstanding. I saw the crowd in Mumbai, and I've never seen a more disgustingly racist display in cricket, anywhere. Don't insult our intelligence by saying it wasn't racist. If it wasn't, then why Symonds? Why not call Ponting a chimp? Or Hayden a gorilla? The players were explicitly made aware before the series that monkey was unacceptable, specifically because Harbhajan used that word in India.<br />I'm not saying Australia is blameless, but when they overstep the mark they admit it, apologise and cop the penalty. Indian players, it seems, throw a tantrum and threaten to quit playing. Only one team is acting in the spirit of cricket, and it's not India Mr Kumble. </div></div> <span class="DateCreated"> January 2008 </span> </p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --> <span class="crickety">www.crickety.com</span>
