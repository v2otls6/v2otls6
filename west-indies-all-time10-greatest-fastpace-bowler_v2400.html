					<p class="Message">West Indies have/had so many outstanding fast/pace bowler. The top five was extremely difficult to place in chronological order, specifically what one is looking for, if its durability-The likes of Coutney Walsh, speed-Michael Holding,<br />Economical-Joel Garner and/or Curtly Ambrose<br />Combination of all of the above: The incomparable Malcolm Marshall<br /><br />Meril's top 10 (fast/pace/medium) bowler<br /><br />(1) Malcolm Marshall: Arguably West Indies greatest fast bowler, a combination of speed and unplayable line and length delivery.<br /><br />(2) Curtly Ambrose: Similiar to 'Big Bird' Joel Garner in terms of delivery, one of the most lethal 'yorker' An economical bowler.<br /><br />(3) Joel 'Big Bird' Garner: One of the most difficult bowler to score runs against, very economical bowler.<br /><br />(4) 'Whispering Death' Michael Holding: The quickest of 'em all, defeat batsman with sheer speed, and incredible accuracy.<br /><br />(5) Courtney Walsh: Not as quick as 'Holding, Gilchrist, Patterson and/or Marshall, but the most durable, took most test wickess amongst West Indies fast bowlers.<br /><br />(6) Anderson (Andy) Roberts: One of West Indies premier fast bowler during the 70's<br /><br />(7) Colin Croft: One of the greatest, outswinger, inswinger delivery, can take wickets on any pitch, if not for playing in South Africa, how many wickets could this great West Indian taken?<br /><br />(8) Wesley Hall: The originator of West Indies fast bowlers. in his era, considered to be one of the greatest<br /><br />(9) Charlie Griffith: Partner of Wesley Hall, signature play-The 'lethal yorker'<br /><br />(10) Ian Bishop: Decimated by injuries. A great fast bowler.<br /><br />Notable omissions: (a) Patrick Patterson-one of the quickest, but line and length is not on par with Holding. (b) Roy Gilchrist-Such a great fast bowler, speed and accuracy, but allowed his temper to take precedence over his emotions. (c) Jermaine Taylor-A Talent waiting to happen<br /><br />Players that did not live up to expectation are: Wayne Daniel, Slyvester Clarke, Reon King, and Collymore.<br /><br />Franklin Stevenson played a meagre amount of test so I did not rate him.<br /><br />Note: I did not rate Sir Garfield Sobers because he bowled everything, including spin, medium and pace bowler<br /><br /><br /><br /><b></b><b></b><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj"></div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">WHAT ABOUT BISHOP</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">10 Best West Indian Pace Bowlers</div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">Here is my list for the 19 best Windies pace bowlers of all time. It's a bit different from Meril's list:<br /><br />1. Malcolm Marshall. Arguably the greatest pace bowler of all time.<br />Had it all!<br /><br />2. Curtly Ambrose - speed, hostility and accuracy coming from an<br />awesome height; had the ability to raise his game a couple<br />notches seemingly on demand. A devastating strike bowler.<br /><br />3. Wes Hall - the pioneer of modern WI pace bowlers; pace, a lion's<br />heart and amazing stamina; the best International pace bowler of<br />his time.<br /><br />4. Michael Holding - The Rolls Royce of pace bowlers- lightning<br />quick.<br /><br />5. Andy Roberts - The thinker behind the original Famous Four.<br /><br />6. Joel Garner - Many of Ambrose's attributes without perhaps his<br />hostility and pace. Big Bird was a giant in so many ways.<br /><br />7. Courtney Walsh - Mr. Longevity; the first bowler to reach 500 Test<br />wickets - a phenomenal feat for a pace bowler.<br /><br />8. Manny Martindale - The best of the pioneers of pace bowlers- had pace, hostility and much more.<br /><br />9. Learie Constantine - Quick, accurate and very hostile. Another of the pioneers.<br /><br />10. Gary Sobers - the fact that he is the greatest cricketer of all timrs and could bowl in any of three styles should not be held against him. An outstanding exponent of the art of pace bowling; his being left-handed, of course, was a bonus.</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">Respond to response!</div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">Hello Francis,<br /><br />I'm impressed with your top 10 West Indies pace/fast bowler in response to my opinion. I agree that Sir Garfield Sobers should not be penalized, because of his rare talent of bowling pace and spin, accompanied by being the greatest all-rounder to ever play the game; however, I cannot omit Colin Croft, when Croft left for the rebel tour, he was one of the greatest fast bowler, his economical rating was high and in a pace quartet, he took the incredible figures in test of 8 for 29 runs on one innings and ODI 6 for 15runs<br /><br />Ian Bishop was great, but was decimated by injuries.<br /><br />Charlie Griffith, unquestionably had some of the greatest yorker in his repertoire<br /><br />Regarding Sir Leary Constantine and Manny Martindale. I cannot comment, because unfortunately I read of their talent, contribution and greatness, but didn't get the opportunity to see them perform. I will browse some tapes in the near future<br /><br />Thank you,</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">greatest west indian fast bowlers</div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">Wes Hall - the best between 1950 and 1975 for them, very committed, fast and always competitive<br />Andy Roberts - wily old bowler who knew pace wasn't all there was to bowling - his length and deviation off the pitch were very good<br />Michael Holding - the fastest bowler in the world off his time. very efficient, economical and a superb athlete<br />Malcolm Marshall - as nasty as they get. richards used to consider him the best he faced. superb control and very good pace too.<br />Curtley Ambrose - that rheight of his added an extra dimension to his craft. and he had craft in plenty. perth, 1993<br />Colin Croft - another 'nasty'. one of the best of the 70's with holding and roberts<br />Courtney Walsh - probably the quietest of the lot, but very effective. no frills, no fuss, but he did the the trick<br />Gary Sobers - some said his bouncer was faster than Hall's! clever bowler.<br />Joel Garner - probably the most difficult to score off out of all these. not as great a wicket taker as the rest, but quite good.<br />Manny Martindale - pre-War bowler, along with Constantine, formed one of the great pace duos of the time</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj">The Master</div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">1 Marshall<br />2 Ambrose<br />3 Holding<br />4 Garner<br />5 Walsh<br />6 Hall<br />7 Roberts<br />8 Bishop<br />9 Croft<br />10 Griffith<br /><br />The top 8 all had a considerable impact at test level for a sustained period, the last two had shorter test careers but were feared in their time for their pace and hostility.<br />You are harsh on Daniel and Clarke who were extremely unlucky to be around at the same time as Marshall, Holding, Garner, Roberts and Croft. Both would have walked into the side of any other test nation.<br />What about the greatest new ball parnership for another debate?<br />Hall and Griffith? Roberts and Holding? Garner and Marshall? Ambrose and Walsh?</div></div><div class="o_post"><div class="o_post_subj"></div><div class="o_post_auth">Anonymous</div><div class="o_post_text">Remember Tony Gray?
